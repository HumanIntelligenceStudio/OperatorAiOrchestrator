## Introduction to Cadence Operational Tasks

This handbook guides operational staff, such as department and clinic managers, through four key performance indicators for scheduling. Under each topic are more specific subtopics that cover a specific challenge or piece of the performance indicator. Each subtopic includes information on why that challenge or piece is important for the key performance indicator, ideas on how to report on or investigate the information at your organization, and ways to improve that piece so as to improve your performance indicators overall.

### Major Players

You'll want to include the following people in the planning and investigation for these topics:

- Organization application analysts or project team members
- Department managers, clinic managers, and other operational staff

### Timelines

The timeline for each of the topics and subtopics depends on current initiatives and priorities at your organization. As you take on projects to improve each of these areas, make sure to set goals and timelines for milestones in the project, such as:

- Investigation and analysis
- Goals and project planning
- System build
- Testing
- Training
- Validation of outcomes

## Provider Accessibility

Provider accessibility is the measure of how open schedules are to patients or how soon patients can be seen by a provider. This is an important indicator for staffing as well as schedule management. If providers aren't accessible enough, they can't see patients in a timely manner. This can reduce patient happiness or cause new patients to seek treatment elsewhere.

Three major components of provider accessibility are:

- How open schedules are to new patients
- How open schedules are to sick patients
- Whether schedules account for seasonal trends

### Measuring and Improving New Patient Access

New patient appointment volumes and accessibility are key to patient satisfaction and revenue. In order to build provider templates that are efficient, departments must first set goals for how many new patients they need to see a day, based on expectations of new patient lead times and patient turnover. Once these goals are established, you can use the tools listed to build departments to effectively meet those goals. In the long term you should use the monitoring reports described later to react to changes in your departments. When competition in the community changes or your new patient referral volume fluctuates, you can use these tools to adjust the provider templates as appropriate. This process should be an ongoing practice of managing new patient volumes.

This purpose of this chapter is to provide guidance for department managers to reach specific goals for new patient visit volume. The end product of following these instructions should be provider schedules that allow for sufficient new patient visits for healthy business and consistent appointment volumes throughout the year.

Throughout this section, we use the term lead time to refer to the number of days between the date an appointment was made and the date of the appointment itself. The lead time shows how accessible certain departments, providers, and block types are to patients.

#### Understanding New Patient Visits Monitoring

**Why Monitor New Patient Visits**

**Patient Satisfaction:** When patients schedule an appointment with a new provider, they have expectations of how soon they should be seen. If they can't be seen in a timely manner, they might go elsewhere for their healthcare. In a competitive market, patients choose to receive care where they can be seen the soonest. Departments should monitor accessibility for these new patients to help reduce lead times for the department.

**Revenue:** New patient visits are pivotal to the revenue flow in a department. These visits ensure a steady stream of follow up appointments. If there is a drop in new patient visits due to long wait times, revenue can suffer more in the following months when return patient visits decrease. Departments seeking to increase revenue should monitor how many new patient appointments they are filling.

**Regulatory or Grant Requirements:** Your organization might need to report your accessibility metrics to state or federal agencies. For example, one of the core features of the Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) model is promoting accessibility for urgent care services in primary care settings. If you are unsure if your organization participates in any regulatory or grant programs, talk with your regulatory team to see if accessibility is factored in to any programs.

**What it Means to Monitor New Patient Visits**

You can monitor new patient visits in two ways:

- Volume of new patient visits
- Lead times until the next available new patient appointment

A department can monitor either of these metrics to understand what is happening in their department. Departments choose what they wish to monitor based on their goals.

#### Department Goals for New Patients

In order to create provider templates that are optimal for your department, you must first set goals for new patient visits.

You should start with finding answers to these three questions:

1. **What volume do you need to keep new and return visits consistent?**
   - On average, how many return visits does each patient have? The more average return visits, the lower the new patient volume should be. For example, if patients generally come back two times after an initial visit, then you would want one out of every three appointments to be new patients. This means that 33% of your schedule would be new patients.
   - If your clinic is already live on Epic, you can use the reports in the Monitor New Patient Visits section below to see the current distribution of new patients and return patients.

2. **How many days do you think a new patient should wait to get an appointment?**
   - Consider how competitive your clinic needs to be and how long you want return patients to wait. In general, the more quickly new patients can be seen, the longer return patients have to wait. This lead time can be mitigated by using wait list work flows.

3. **How many return patients do you usually have on the wait list?**
   - If this number is high, you can still block new patient slots and then release blocks for the unused slots a few dates out, so return patients on the wait list can then be seen.

After answering these questions, use this information to decide the percentage of new patients you want to see per day. You can use different pieces of Cadence technology to ensure you're seeing the appropriate mix of new patients in your schedule. Finally, decide how many days out to release the slots to allow for other return patient bookings.

**Example 1:** The EMC allergy clinic sees patients who on average return five times to receive allergy treatment and follow up. Thus, they want about 1 out of 6 or 17% of their schedule blocked for new patient visits. EMC allergy clinic is in competition with a neighboring practice and can afford to have new patients wait only one week for their appointments. Because of this competition they decide to err on the safe side and block more time for new patients. They settle on blocking 25% of their schedule slots for new patients. The clinic keeps a long wait list for return patients who are willing to come in on short notice if they can get an earlier appointment. Since the clinic does not want to leave spots empty, they unblock new patient slots four days out to give schedulers time to call return patients to fill the slots.

**Example 2:** The EMC cardiology practice sees patients who on average return for consistent six-month checkups after their first visit. Patients come to the practice for years and they only see about a 10% turnover rate each year. Thus, they want about 1 out of 10 or 10% of their schedule blocked for new patients. The practice is not very competitive and can afford to have new patients wait up to a month for their appointments. They block 12% of their schedule for new patients to account for patient no-shows. Since return patients consistently schedule six months out, they unblock new patient slots just two days out to give schedulers time to fill the slots with urgent return patient visits.

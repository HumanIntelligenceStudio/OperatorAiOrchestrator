## Your Responsibilities for Safe Use

This documentation will help guide you through the available software configuration options so you can decide the right configuration for your organization. Of course, safe and compliant use of the software in any configuration requires you and your users to use good judgment and perform certain responsibilities, including each of the following: enter and read information accurately and completely; be responsible for configuration decisions; ensure compliance with laws and regulations relevant for your organization; confirm the accuracy of critically important medical information (e.g., allergies, medications, results), just as you would with paper records; actively report suspected errors in the software to both Epic and affected personnel; thoroughly test the software to ensure it's accurate before using it; and use the software only according to standards of good medical practice. You also are responsible for training your personnel and other users to perform these responsibilities. Not performing any of these responsibilities may compromise patient safety or your compliance with applicable requirements.

## Overview

Wait lists are a powerful tool for optimizing provider schedules, improving patient access, and maximizing resource utilization. Epic's wait list functionality allows organizations to systematically manage patient demand that exceeds immediate appointment availability, while providing patients with opportunities for earlier appointments when cancellations occur.

- Clear policies and procedures for wait list management
- Effective patient communication and education
- Continuous monitoring and improvement processes

### Identifying Optimal Wait List Scenarios

Determine which appointments and situations benefit most from wait lists:

**High-Value Wait List Scenarios:**
1. **High-Demand Providers**: Popular providers with limited availability
2. **Specialty Appointments**: Limited specialty provider availability
3. **Procedure Scheduling**: Complex procedures with limited slots
4. **Urgent Care Needs**: Patients requiring expedited access
5. **Seasonal Demand**: Appointments with seasonal variation

**Evaluation Criteria:**
- Provider schedule utilization rates
- Average time to next available appointment
- No-show and cancellation rates
- Patient demand patterns and trends
- Staff workload and efficiency measures

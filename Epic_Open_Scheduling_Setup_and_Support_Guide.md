## Your Responsibilities for Safe Use

This documentation will help guide you through the available software configuration options so you can decide the right configuration for your organization. Of course, safe and compliant use of the software in any configuration requires you and your users to use good judgment and perform certain responsibilities, including each of the following: enter and read information accurately and completely; be responsible for configuration decisions; ensure compliance with laws and regulations relevant for your organization; confirm the accuracy of critically important medical information (e.g., allergies, medications, results), just as you would with paper records; actively report suspected errors in the software to both Epic and affected personnel; thoroughly test the software to ensure it's accurate before using it; and use the software only according to standards of good medical practice. You also are responsible for training your personnel and other users to perform these responsibilities. Not performing any of these responsibilities may compromise patient safety or your compliance with applicable requirements.

## Overview

Open Scheduling allows patients to schedule appointments directly through MyChart without requiring staff intervention. This self-service scheduling option improves patient satisfaction by providing immediate access to available appointment slots while reducing administrative workload for scheduling staff.

## Open Scheduling Setup: Essentials

### Configure Individual Departments and Specialties for Open Scheduling

Department-level configuration controls which appointments can be scheduled through open scheduling:

**Department Configuration Steps:**
1. **Enable Open Scheduling**: Turn on open scheduling functionality for specific departments
2. **Set Visit Type Availability**: Define which visit types can be scheduled through open scheduling
3. **Configure Time Restrictions**: Set minimum advance booking requirements and maximum future booking limits
4. **Establish Provider Participation**: Determine which providers in the department participate in open scheduling
5. **Set Patient Eligibility Rules**: Define which patients can use open scheduling for the department

**Specialty-Specific Considerations:**
- Primary Care: Often allows broad open scheduling access for routine visits
- Specialty Care: May restrict open scheduling to established patients or specific visit types
- Procedural Areas: Typically require more restrictive open scheduling settings due to preparation requirements

### Enable Individual Clinicians for Open Scheduling

Provider-level settings allow fine-tuned control over open scheduling availability:

**Provider Configuration Options:**
1. **Individual Provider Participation**: Enable or disable open scheduling for specific providers
2. **Schedule Block Management**: Control which schedule blocks are available for open scheduling
3. **Patient Population Restrictions**: Limit open scheduling to established patients or specific patient groups
4. **Appointment Type Limitations**: Restrict which visit types can be scheduled with specific providers

**Best Practices for Provider Configuration:**
- Start with conservative settings and expand based on experience
- Monitor provider schedule utilization and patient satisfaction
- Adjust settings based on provider feedback and workflow preferences
- Consider provider preferences for patient scheduling patterns

### Enable Open Scheduling System Wide

System-wide settings provide overarching control and default behaviors:

**System Configuration Elements:**
1. **Global Enable/Disable**: Master switch for open scheduling functionality
2. **Default Behaviors**: Set system-wide defaults for departments and providers
3. **Security Settings**: Configure user access and administrative controls
4. **Integration Settings**: Connect open scheduling with other Epic modules
5. **Monitoring and Reporting**: Enable tracking of open scheduling usage and outcomes

### Use the Redesigned Open Scheduling Wizard

The redesigned open scheduling wizard provides an enhanced patient experience:

**Key Features:**
- Improved user interface with better navigation
- Enhanced appointment search capabilities
- Better integration with decision trees and questionnaires
- Streamlined appointment confirmation process
- Mobile-optimized design for smartphone and tablet access

**Configuration Options:**
- Customize the appearance and flow of the scheduling wizard
- Configure decision tree integration for visit type selection
- Set up automated patient instructions and preparation materials
- Enable integration with insurance verification processes

### Use the Open Scheduling Widget

The open scheduling widget provides quick access to scheduling functionality:

**Widget Configuration:**
- Placement options within MyChart interface
- Customizable appearance and branding
- Quick access to most commonly scheduled appointment types
- Integration with patient's scheduling history and preferences

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Patient education on widget functionality
- Staff training on supporting patients using the widget
- Monitoring of widget usage patterns and patient feedback
- Regular updates based on patient needs and usage analytics

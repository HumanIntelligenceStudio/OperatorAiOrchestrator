## Your Responsibilities for Safe Use

This documentation will help guide you through the available software configuration options so you can decide the right configuration for your organization. Of course, safe and compliant use of the software in any configuration requires you and your users to use good judgment and perform certain responsibilities, including each of the following: enter and read information accurately and completely; be responsible for configuration decisions; ensure compliance with laws and regulations relevant for your organization; confirm the accuracy of critically important medical information (e.g., allergies, medications, results), just as you would with paper records; actively report suspected errors in the software to both Epic and affected personnel; thoroughly test the software to ensure it's accurate before using it; and use the software only according to standards of good medical practice. You also are responsible for training your personnel and other users to perform these responsibilities. Not performing any of these responsibilities may compromise patient safety or your compliance with applicable requirements.

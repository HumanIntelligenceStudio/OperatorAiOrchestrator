# OperatorOS Deployment: Shoulder Arthroplasty Reimbursement Analysis

## System Initialization Command
```
Create a comprehensive medical research analysis system for shoulder arthroplasty reimbursement trends using OperatorOS multi-agent orchestration platform.
```

## Primary Agent Configuration

### Healthcare Analytics Specialist Agent
**Agent Type**: Medical Research & Healthcare Economics  
**Primary Model**: Claude Sonnet-4 (regulatory compliance, medical analysis)  
**Secondary Model**: Grok-2 (business intelligence, market trends)  
**Tertiary Model**: OpenAI GPT-4o (data processing, statistical analysis)

## Task Specification

### Data Collection Requirements
Execute comprehensive analysis of procedural trends in shoulder arthroplasty through the following systematic approach:

#### CPT Codes for Analysis
1. **CPT 23470**: Arthroplasty, glenohumeral joint; hemiarthroplasty
2. **CPT 23472**: Arthroplasty, glenohumeral joint; total shoulder anatomical or reverse
3. **CPT 23473**: Revision of shoulder hemiarthroplasty, including allograft when performed
4. **CPT 23474**: Revision of total shoulder arthroplasty, including allograft when performed

#### Primary Data Sources
- **CMS Physician Fee Schedule Look-Up Tool** (2015-2025)
- **Medicare Administrative Contractor** pricing data
- **US Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics** CPI data
- **Medical Care-specific CPI** inflation adjustments

### Multi-Agent Analysis Workflow

#### Phase 1: Data Acquisition Agent
**Objective**: Collect comprehensive reimbursement data from CMS database

**Instructions**:
1. Query CMS Physician Fee Schedule Look-Up Tool for each CPT code
2. Extract pricing information for all Medicare Administrative Contractor options
3. Collect modifier-specific reimbursement rates
4. Aggregate geographical iterations of reimbursements
5. Generate averaged comprehensive reimbursement data (2015-2025)

#### Phase 2: Economic Analysis Agent  
**Objective**: Perform inflation adjustment and statistical analysis

**Instructions**:
1. Calculate unadjusted percent change in reimbursement rates (2015-2025)
2. Collect All Items Consumer Price Index data (2015-2025)
3. Collect Medical Care-specific CPI data (2015-2025)
4. Apply annual compound adjustment methodology
5. Convert all data to 2025 dollar equivalents
6. Generate adjusted average annual and total percentage changes

#### Phase 3: Statistical Comparison Agent
**Objective**: Execute comparative statistical analysis

**Instructions**:
1. Perform two-tailed Student t-test comparison of means
2. Compare reimbursement change vs All Items CPI change
3. Compare reimbursement change vs Medical Care CPI change
4. Execute subanalysis: primary vs revision procedures
5. Apply significance threshold (P < 0.05)
6. Generate statistical significance reports

#### Phase 4: Visualization & Geographic Analysis Agent
**Objective**: Create comprehensive data visualizations

**Instructions**:
1. Utilize Google Sheets GeoMap for geographic representation
2. Map mean 2020 physician reimbursement per episode (primary TSA)
3. Map mean 2020 physician reimbursement per episode (revision TSA)
4. Visualize mean percent change in inflation-adjusted Medicare reimbursement (2015-2025)
5. Create state-by-state comparative analysis
6. Generate comprehensive visual report suite

### Analytical Comparisons Required

#### Primary vs Revision Analysis
- Compare mean percent change: primary procedures vs revision procedures
- Statistical significance testing using Student t-test
- Direct comparisons:
  - Primary TSA vs Revision TSA
  - Primary hemiarthroplasty vs Revision hemiarthroplasty

#### Economic Context Analysis
- Medical inflation impact assessment
- Consumer price fluctuation correlation
- Regional reimbursement variation analysis
- Procedural trend identification (2015-2025)

## Output Specifications

### Required Deliverables
1. **Comprehensive Statistical Report**: Multi-agent analysis synthesis
2. **Geographic Visualization Suite**: State-by-state reimbursement mapping
3. **Trend Analysis Dashboard**: Inflation-adjusted reimbursement changes
4. **Comparative Analysis Report**: Primary vs revision procedure economics
5. **Raw Data Archive**: Complete dataset with methodology documentation

### Quality Assurance Protocol
- **Multi-Model Validation**: Cross-verify calculations across all three AI providers
- **Statistical Verification**: Confirm t-test results and significance levels
- **Data Integrity Checks**: Validate CMS data extraction accuracy
- **Inflation Adjustment Verification**: Confirm CPI application methodology

## Execution Command

```
Deploy healthcare analytics agent pool for shoulder arthroplasty reimbursement analysis. Execute comprehensive data collection from CMS Physician Fee Schedule Look-Up Tool for CPT codes 23470, 23472, 23473, 23474 spanning 2015-2025. Apply dual CPI adjustment methodology (All Items and Medical Care). Perform statistical significance testing using two-tailed Student t-test. Generate geographic visualization suite using Google Sheets GeoMap. Deliver comprehensive multi-agent analysis report with primary vs revision procedure comparison.
```

## Success Metrics
- **Data Completeness**: 100% CPT code coverage across all years
- **Statistical Accuracy**: Proper t-test implementation with significance testing
- **Visualization Quality**: Professional-grade geographic mapping
- **Analysis Depth**: 30,000+ character comprehensive report
- **Multi-Provider Validation**: Consensus across Claude, Grok, and OpenAI analyses

## Implementation Timeline
- **Phase 1 (Data Collection)**: Immediate execution
- **Phase 2 (Economic Analysis)**: Real-time processing
- **Phase 3 (Statistical Analysis)**: Automated statistical testing
- **Phase 4 (Visualization)**: Geographic mapping generation
- **Final Report**: Comprehensive synthesis delivery

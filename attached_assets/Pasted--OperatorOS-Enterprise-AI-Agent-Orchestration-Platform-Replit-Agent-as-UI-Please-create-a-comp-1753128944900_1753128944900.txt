# OperatorOS - Enterprise AI Agent Orchestration Platform (Replit Agent as UI)

Please create a complete implementation of OperatorOS, an enterprise-grade multi-agent AI orchestration system designed specifically to work with **Replit Agent as the primary user interface**. This is an unconventional architecture where all user interactions happen through Replit Agent conversations rather than traditional web interfaces.

## Unconventional Architecture Overview

**Key Design Principle**: Replit Agent serves as both the development environment AND the primary user interface for the entire OperatorOS system. Users interact with the AI orchestration platform through natural language conversations with Replit Agent, which then executes the appropriate backend operations.

### Architecture Components
- **Replit Agent**: Primary UI layer - handles all user interactions via conversational interface
- **Flask API Backend**: Headless API server for system operations (no traditional web UI)
- **Agent Master Controller**: Core orchestration engine with enterprise-grade features
- **Specialized Agent Pools**: Domain-specific AI agents accessible through Replit Agent
- **OpenAI Assistants Integration**: Persistent conversation management
- **Command Interface**: CLI-style commands that Replit Agent can execute

- "How are the agent pools performing?"
- "What tasks are currently running?"
- "Display health metrics"

### 2. Task Submission
Users interact naturally:
- "I need medical advice about chest pain symptoms"
- "Analyze AAPL stock performance and give investment recommendations" 
- "Help me automate my project management workflow"
- "Create a sports betting strategy for tonight's games"

### 3. Agent Pool Management
Through conversation:
- "Scale up the healthcare agent pool"
- "Check the status of financial agents"
- "Restart failed agents"
- "Show me agent performance metrics"

### 4. Interactive Demos
- "Show me a healthcare demo"
- "Walk me through financial analysis capabilities"
- "Demonstrate sports analytics features"
- "Run a business automation example"

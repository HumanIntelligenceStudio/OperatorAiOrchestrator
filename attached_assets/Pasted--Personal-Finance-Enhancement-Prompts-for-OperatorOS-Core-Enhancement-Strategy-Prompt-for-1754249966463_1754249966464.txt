# üè¶ Personal Finance Enhancement Prompts for OperatorOS

## Core Enhancement Strategy

**Prompt for Replit Agent:**
```
I want to enhance OperatorOS with comprehensive personal finance capabilities. The platform currently excels at enterprise financial analysis with multi-currency support, AI-powered investment analysis, and real-time data integration. Now I need to extend this for individual users with:

1. Personal budget tracking and expense categorization
2. Financial goal setting and progress monitoring  
3. Personal investment portfolio management
4. Debt tracking and payoff strategies
5. Savings optimization recommendations
6. Personal financial health scoring

Build on the existing financial agent pool architecture and conversational interface. Keep the natural language interaction through Replit Agent as the primary interface.

Primary Data Sources

CMS Physician Fee Schedule Look-Up Tool (2015-2025)
Medicare Administrative Contractor pricing data
US Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics CPI data
Medical Care-specific CPI inflation adjustments

Multi-Agent Analysis Workflow
Phase 1: Data Acquisition Agent
Objective: Collect comprehensive reimbursement data from CMS database
Instructions:

Query CMS Physician Fee Schedule Look-Up Tool for each CPT code
Extract pricing information for all Medicare Administrative Contractor options
Collect modifier-specific reimbursement rates
Aggregate geographical iterations of reimbursements
Generate averaged comprehensive reimbursement data (2015-2025)

Phase 2: Economic Analysis Agent
Objective: Perform inflation adjustment and statistical analysis
Instructions:

Calculate unadjusted percent change in reimbursement rates (2015-2025)
Collect All Items Consumer Price Index data (2015-2025)
Collect Medical Care-specific CPI data (2015-2025)
Apply annual compound adjustment methodology
Convert all data to 2025 dollar equivalents
Generate adjusted average annual and total percentage changes

Phase 3: Statistical Comparison Agent
Objective: Execute comparative statistical analysis
Instructions:

Perform two-tailed Student t-test comparison of means
Compare reimbursement change vs All Items CPI change
Compare reimbursement change vs Medical Care CPI change
Execute subanalysis: primary vs revision procedures
Apply significance threshold (P < 0.05)
Generate statistical significance reports

Phase 4: Visualization & Geographic Analysis Agent
Objective: Create comprehensive data visualizations
Instructions:

Utilize Google Sheets GeoMap for geographic representation
Map mean 2020 physician reimbursement per episode (primary TSA)
Map mean 2020 physician reimbursement per episode (revision TSA)
Visualize mean percent change in inflation-adjusted Medicare reimbursement (2015-2025)
Create state-by-state comparative analysis
Generate comprehensive visual report suite

Analytical Comparisons Required
Primary vs Revision Analysis

Compare mean percent change: primary procedures vs revision procedures
Statistical significance testing using Student t-test
Direct comparisons:

Primary TSA vs Revision TSA
Primary hemiarthroplasty vs Revision hemiarthroplasty
